% This function is called by the build system before any other function
% is called to actually generate a plot. You can do setup commands here
% which you might normally run at the matlab command prompt before
% calling the plot functions. The most common use of this function is to
% add subdirectories of the mat directory to the matlab search path.
% Please read the documenation in 'albs-uguide.txt' for more details on
% how the Automatic LaTeX Build System works.
